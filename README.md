Disney movies are known to play on the watchers emotions. When watching a Disney movie one can become happy, but also sad. Oftentimes, these emotions are interchanged throughout the movie. By doing this Disney makes sure it's watchers are invested and kept on their time while watching. This emotional roller coaster wouldn't be the same without Disney's distinctive soundtracks. By using different music themes the movie is taken to a new level and a watcher can feel happiness, sadness, anger, pain and a lot of other emotions. Funny moments can be reinforced with typical "funny" music. During this project I will look at a corpus of Disney songs and examin it using machine learning. By doing this I will try do discover if the different types of emotions that Disney Music evoke can be linked to specific music genres. It would be interesting to see if the Disney music corpus can be divided into diferent "emotion" music groups. 

It would also be interesting to see what other information can be gathered from these groups. For instance, if the artist are different or the same. Maybe the instruments used and the tempo are also important for the emotions a song evokes. 


Homework 7:
Plot for home work 7 in this file on github: plot hoemwork 7.png

In this plot 2 playlists are combined. The first playlist, containing 42 songs, has been categorized as sad by the album creator. The second playlist, containing 30 songs, has been categorized as happy by the album creator. "Happy" songs are red in this plot and "Sad" songs are blue. The 3 variables that are combined here are energy, valence and daneability. It is interesting to see that the spotify algorithm seems to have found the same results as the album creators. The sad songs score relatively low in all variables and the happy songs have a relatively high score. In the plot one can see a clear difference between the two album categories.
